# Arkolour
Original Arkolour game.

This game was made in Java 6, using only the libraries in the standard edition JDK. The IDE I used was Netbeans ( I don't remember the version number ). Now a remake is currently work in progress <a href="https://github.com/FireBellyToad/ArkolourMin">here</a>

It's simple Arkanoid clone, with some little gameplay variations: The Pad and the Ball can have three colors: Red, Blue and Yellow. Whenever the ball touches a Brick, it gets the Brick color. Some Bricks may have multiple colors, in which case the Ball color will be chosen randomly. There are some Powerups and some Mali which may alter the Ball or the Pad properties. Here the keyboard keys to play:

<ul>
  <li>Arrow keys: Move the Pad</li>
  <li>Tasto 'A': Pad becomes red</li>
  <li>Tasto 'S': Pad becomes yellow</li>
  <li>Tasto 'D': Pad becomes blue</li>
  <li>Tasto 'P': Pauses the game</li>
  <li>Tasto 'S': Saves the game ( only while Paused )</li>
</ul>

To play the game, just run the jar in the /Arkolour/ folder.
